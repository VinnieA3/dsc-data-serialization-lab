    "Now that you have learned about CSV and JSON file formats individually, it's time to bring them together with a cumulative lab! Even as a junior data scientist, you can often produce novel, interesting analyses by combining multiple datasets that haven't been combined before.\n",

    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Practice reading serialized JSON and CSV data from files into Python objects\n",
    "* Practice extracting information from nested data structures\n",
    "* Practice cleaning data (filtering, normalizing locations, converting types)\n",
    "* Combine data from multiple sources into a single data structure\n",
    "* Interpret descriptive statistics and data visualizations to present your findings\n",
